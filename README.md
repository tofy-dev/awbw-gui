# Advance Wars by Web GUI
Still in early development, but it will be able to view replays + allow turn planning at some point in the future.

## Development
### Linux
- install SDL2 (and relevant libraries) / GIFLib

### Windows
- in powershell, run utils/init_headers.sh
- set OS in Makefile to Windows
- wget is not in git bash by default, view the aformentioned script for more details
- 64bit systems only; some fiddling will likely be necessary to get the headers to work
